# pokedex

A flutter project that displays Pokemon from [Pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/)

## Another Pokedex app, why???

I'm using this purely as my own testing ground for different Flutter concepts, and there's a lot of nice looking UIs
that I can take inspiration from, without outright copying, to go along with that. The PokeAPI also comes with its own challenges
as getting detailed pokemon information requires iterative calls to their API which can be slow, which adds another reason to test concepts against it.
